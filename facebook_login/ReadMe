In this test I attempted to login to Facebook using Selenium Web Driver. 2 step authentication makes this impossible without user input
of the 6 digit code texted to confirm that you are the account holder. Facebook also blocks your use of 2 step authentication if
you use it to frequently. I found this out by attempting to test my script repeatedly.
In the end, I became proficient in using locators to find the appropriate elements, input text and press buttons. I also 
learned about Facebook's security features.
